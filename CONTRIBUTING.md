# Contributing to letsencrypt-cloudflare-hook

We welcome all contributions! This repository is actively maintained and participates in **Hacktoberfest**.

The maintainer appreciates small, focused changes that help improve the project's quality and clarity.

## ðŸš€ How to Contribute

Since this is a smaller project, the easiest ways to contribute are:

1.  **Documentation & Clarity:** Improve existing `README.md` content, add clearer examples, or fix typos.
2.  **Code Cleanup:** Fix minor bugs or address code quality issues.
3.  **Tests:** Increase test coverage (this project uses Python, so adding to the `tests/` directory is ideal).

## ðŸ’¡ Submitting Your Contribution

1.  **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Clone** your fork locally: `git clone YOUR_FORK_URL`
3.  Create a **new branch** for your feature or fix (e.g., `git checkout -b fix/typo-in-readme`).
4.  Make your changes.
5.  **Test your changes** to ensure the hook still works correctly.
6.  Commit your changes with a descriptive message (e.g., `feat: Add CONTRIBUTING.md guide`).
7.  Push your branch to your fork.
8.  Open a **Pull Request (PR)** from your branch to the `main` branch of `SeattleDevs/letsencrypt-cloudflare-hook`.

### Pull Request Guidelines

* Keep PRs focused on a single change.
* Clearly explain the **"why"** behind your contribution.
* Reference the issue number if you are fixing a bug (though there are currently no open issues!).
